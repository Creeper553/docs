# Render Controls - Scene

### Open scene directory
This opens the Chunky scenes directory. It is `~/.chunky/scenes` by default.

### Export settings
This allows you to export settings to a copy-able JSON. You can individually
choose which settings to export.

### Import settings
This allows you to import settings generated by `Export settings`.

![import](../../img/user_interface/scene_import.png)

### Restore default settings
Reset all scene settings to the default.

### Load selected chunks
Load the chunks selected in the Map view into Chunky. Once clicked, this will
load each chunk of the Minecraft world (which may take a while)! After this
process completes, you may begin rendering.

### Reload chunks
Re-load the chunks. This requires that the current selected world is the same
as the world used to create the scene.

---

### Canvas size
This is the resolution at which to render.

There are `x0.5`, `x1.5`, and `x2` buttons which scale the canvas size by
the specified number.

### Load players
If this checkbox is checked, player models are loaded when loading a world.

### Enable biome colors
This checkbox controls biome tinting of natural blocks like grass or leaves.

### Save dump once every ...
This checkbox controls if Chunky will automatically save the scene and render
periodically while rendering.

### Save snapshot for each dump
This checkbox controls if Chunky will automatically generate a snapshot and
save it when the dump is saved when rendering.

### Y-min clip
This controls the minimum loaded level inclusively. For example if it is set to 0,
all blocks at and above `y=0` are loaded.
