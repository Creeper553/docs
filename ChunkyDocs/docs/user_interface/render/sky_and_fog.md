# Render Controls - Sky & Fog

### Sky mode

##### Simulated
This is the default sky mode that attempts to simulate a real-life sky.
There are currently 2 simulation models: Preetham and Nishita. In both
sky modes, `Horizon offset` can be adjusted to push the simulated horizon
below the real horizon.

Preetham is a faster, approximate simulation of daytime skies. It is most
similar to Minecraft.

Nishita is a slower, simulation of all skies. It is most photorealistic
but may be challenging to setup since it is not rendered below the horizon.
It is best for low sun angles, such as a sunrise or sunset.

##### Solid color
Set the sky to a solid color.

##### Color Gradient
Select a color gradient from the horizon to the peak of the sky

##### Skymap (panoramic)
Select an equiangular skymap. This may be either from the horizon up or the
full sphere. Skymap rotation controls the rotation of the skymap.

##### Skymap (spherical)
IDK lol

##### Skybox
Select a skybox with 6 textures, one for each face.

##### Black
Sky is solid black.
